How to program using mindf+:

This language uses the EXACT syntax that brainfuck uses, with the following differences:

additions:
	} to end a [ ] loop (makes it an if statement)
	$x to modify the condition (x is the new value, default is 0)
	=x to set a constant integer (x is the value)
	@x to set a constant ascii character (x is the value)
	Sx to set a special character (x is the char) [n = \n; 0 = \0]
	H to set ptr to 0 (go home)
inherited from brainfuck:
	[ code ] code is executed as long as the current pointer is not the condition (see $ above) this is a loop
	. print the byte to the screen
	, read a byte
	+ increment the byte
	- decrement the byte
	> move right
	< move left
usage:
	./m+ <opt> <file>
	<opt> is optional, c=compile <file> to out.mp e=execute <file>
	<file> is mandatory, if no options are specified, it is compiled and executed
